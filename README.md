# SnowProfiler SoftwareRepository

Hello User, 

this is the code repository of the snow profiler. It consists of three parts: 
- the [Arduino](Arduino) (Force), 
- the [Steval Sensor Tile](Raspberry) (IMU) and 
- the [Raspberry](StevalSensorTile) (Main Unit).


The [Flowchart](FlowChart.jpg) of the whole code is found here.
 
 

## How to use the software
### Prerequirements:
- Firmware is uploaded on Steval Sensor Tile and Arduino -> Should be done
- Laptop or PC in the same Network as the Snow Profiler (Attention: No WLAN is available. Use a good, old patch cable)
- SSH Client on your machine
- SSH connection established. User: `pi` and password: `raspberry`

### Run the software

Navigate to the code folder 
```
cd SnowProfiler_SoftwareRepository/Raspberry/
```

build firmware if needed
```
bash buildFirmware.sh
```

run executable
```
./Raspby_Firmware
```

if everything is done correct, the output should look like the following example. Now the measurements can be done without further interventions in the software.
